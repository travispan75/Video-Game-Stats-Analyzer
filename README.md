Pok√©mon Showdown Stats Analyzer

This project is a full-stack MERN application built to fetch, clean, store, and visualize Pokemon battle statistics from Pokemon Showdown's Overused tier. The application uses Node.js and Express for backend server
processes, middleware, and API calls. Data is scraped from the web using Python's BeautifulSoup library and cleaned, organized, and processed using pandas and NumPy. The data is stored in a MongoDB database, 
which can then be queried. The application scrapes new data monthly, ensuring statistics are up-to-date. 

React is used to create a dynamic, modular, and optimized frontend. Currently, only the statistics page of the website is available. Future pages will be added soon. When accessing the site, keep in mind that during
times of low activity, the site goes to sleep and may take a few minutes to start up as it is using free website hosting services.
